## Description

The Weekly Planner is a user-friendly web application designed to help you organize your week effortlessly. It presents each day with dedicated text fields, allowing you to add simple notes, tasks, or reminders. A key feature of this planner is its automatic reset functionality, which clears all notes every Monday, preparing a fresh slate for your new week.

## Technologies

This project leverages a modern front-end stack to deliver a responsive and interactive user experience:

*   **Alpine.js**: A rugged, minimal JavaScript framework for composing behavior directly in your markup.
*   **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types, enhancing code quality and maintainability.
*   **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
*   **HTML**: The standard markup language for creating web pages.
