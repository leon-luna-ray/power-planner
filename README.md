Work Day Scheduler v 2.0

ðŸš§ Currently being refactored ðŸš§

* Created time blocks in HTML.
* Changed styling for color of the time blocks and added margin to the bottom of the page.
* Used jQuery to create event listeners for each of the block entries and save the entry to local storage.
* Entries are saved to local storage but I could not find a way to retrive it from local storage.
* Imported moment.js for the date and time.
* Appended the current date to the top of the page.
* Created jQuery function to dynamically change the color based on the time of the day.
